# Remotion Video

Turn a PR into a rendered short-form promo video with a hook, code moments, and CTA, using Remotion. Iterate with live preview in Remotion Studio, then render `video.mp4` and `poster.jpg` for X/LinkedIn/social.

Unlike `/video-script` (which produces a textual script), this skill produces the actual video file.

## Triggers

Invoke when the user says: "make a video for this PR", "remotion video", "render a promo video", "video for X/LinkedIn", or when selected from `/marketing-pipeline`.

## Process Flow

```
Resolve input
  → Phase 1: Discovery
  → Phase 2: Configuration
  → Phase 3: Narrative planning
  → Phase 4: Scaffold
  → Phase 5: First draft + iterate
  → Phase 6: Render
  → Phase 7: Cleanup
```

Each phase has an approval gate. Phase 5 is a freeform loop that can run many rounds.

## Input Resolution

Resolve the argument (if provided) in this order:

1. Path to a marketing brief (`.md` containing "Executive Summary" or "Key Messages") → **marketing brief**
2. Path to a blog post (`.md` with blog post structure) → **blog post**
3. Path to a changelog → **changelog**
4. GitHub PR URL or `#\d+` pattern → **PR**
5. Contains `...` or `..` → **git ref range**
6. Resolves to an existing file/directory → **codebase feature**
7. Otherwise → **freeform text**

If no argument is provided, ask: "What should the video be about? You can provide a PR URL/number, marketing brief, blog post, changelog, git ref range, file/directory path, or just describe the feature."

When invoked from the pipeline with a PR *and* upstream marketing-brief/blog-post paths, read both: PR for technical accuracy, upstream content for positioning/tone.

(Detailed phase specs begin below — see Phase 1.)

## Phase 1: Discovery

### Step 1.1 — Check `remotion-best-practices` availability

Attempt to invoke the `remotion-best-practices` skill via the Skill tool. If unavailable, present:

> "The `remotion-best-practices` skill isn't installed. Options:
> a) proceed with baseline Remotion knowledge (quality may be reduced)
> b) wait while you install it
> c) cancel"

If the user picks (a), emit a warning in the final summary noting reduced quality.

### Step 1.2 — Analyze input

| Input type | What to read |
|---|---|
| Marketing brief | positioning, key messages, audience |
| Blog post | headline, narrative, examples |
| Changelog | highest-impact entry |
| PR | `gh pr view <n> --json title,body,files,labels`, diff (`gh pr diff`), commit messages, linked issues |
| Git refs | `git diff <range>` + `git log <range> --oneline` |
| Codebase path | read the specified files/directories |
| Freeform | parse the user's description |

For PRs with 20+ files, filter to user-facing changes only — skip `tests/`, `ci/`, `.github/`, lockfile changes, dep bumps.

**Error handling:**
- `gh` not available → tell the user, ask for an alternative (diff file, freeform description)
- Invalid PR/ref → ask user to verify
- File not found → ask for the correct path

### Step 1.3 — Read product context

Read if they exist: `README.md`, `docs/`, `package.json`. If nothing found, ask: "Can you briefly describe the product and who it's for?"

### Step 1.4 — Present understanding + get scope confirmation

Present:

> "Here's what I'll base the video on:
> - [feature summary bullet 1]
> - [feature summary bullet 2]
>
> The compelling angle: [proposed story seed in one sentence]
>
> Anything to add, remove, or correct?"

**Do not proceed until the user confirms.**

### Step 1.5 — Sensitive content scan

Before continuing, scan for: security patches, internal pricing, credentials, unreleased roadmap items, content marked confidential. Flag anything questionable to the user.
